    big=$a
elif(( $b>=$a && $b>=$c ))  
then

do
echo " ******************************* "
echo "Menu"
echo "1.to find the length of string "
echo "2.Concatenate Strings "
echo "3. compare two strings"
echo "4.exit "
echo "Enter your choice: "
read ch
case $ch in
1) echo "enter first string"
read s1
len=`expr length "$s1"`
echo "Length of '$s1' is $len"
;;
2) echo "enter first string"
read s1
echo "enter second string"
read s2
echo "the concated string is" $s1$s2
;;
3) echo "enter first string"
read s1
echo "enter second string"
read s2
if [ $s1 = $s2 ]
then
echo "strings are equal"
else
echo "strings are not equal"
fi

4) echo "Exit..."
exit

esac
done

echo "Enter your choice: "
read ch
case $ch in

read f1
echo "enter the file name for a copy"
read f2
if [ -f $f1 ]
then
cp $f1 $f2
echo "$f1 is copied to $f2"
else
echo " $f1 does not exit"
fi
;;
2) echo "enter file name to rename"
read f1
echo "enter the new file name for a file"
read f2
if [ -f $f1 ]
then
mv $f1 $f2
echo "$f1 is renamed to $f2"
else
echo " $f1 does not exit"
fi
;;
3) echo "enter file name to be removed"
read f1
if [ -f $f1 ]
then
rm -i $f1
echo "$f1 is removd"
else
echo " $f1 does not exit"
fi
;;
4) echo "Exit..."
exit
;;
esac
done

echo `date`
mem_usage () {
mem_free=`free -m | grep "Mem" | awk '{print $3}'`
echo "memory space remaining : $mem_free MB"
if [ $mem_free -lt 0 ]
 then
    echo "mem warning!!!"
 else
