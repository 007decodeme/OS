Step 1: Install Apache
Open the terminal and type the following commands:
sudo apt update
🔸 This updates your system’s software list.
sudo apt install apache2
🔸 This installs Apache on your system.

🔥 Step 2: Adjust the Firewall (if needed)
First, check what apps can be allowed through the firewall:
sudo ufw app list
🔹 You’ll see a list like this:
Available applications:
  Apache
  Apache Full
  Apache Secure
Allow Apache to run through the firewall:
sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
🔸 This command tells the firewall to allow traffic to the web server.

🧪 Step 3: Check if Apache is Running
Check the status of Apache:
sudo systemctl status apache2
🔸 If it says "active (running)", your web server is working!
If not, start or restart Apache:
sudo systemctl start apache2
or
sudo systemctl restart apache2

🌍 Step 4: Find Your System’s IP Address
To access the web server, you need to know your system's IP address.
Run one of these commands:
ifconfig
or
hostname -I
🔹 Example output:
192.168.233.128

🖥️ Step 5: Test the Web Server in Browser
Open a browser (like Firefox or Chrome).
Type this in the address bar:
http://192.168.233.128
✅ You should see the Apache default welcome page, which means the web server is working!
