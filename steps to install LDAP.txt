🛠️ What is LDAP?
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used to store and manage user and device information in a centralized directory (like a phone book). It’s often used for user authentication in networks.

✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Install and Configure LDAP Server
🔹 Step 1: Update Your System
Open the terminal and type:
$sudo apt-get update
This updates your package list so you get the latest software.

🔹 Step 2: Install LDAP Server
Run this command:
$sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils
slapd: The actual LDAP server.
ldap-utils: Useful tools to manage LDAP (like search and test).

🔹 Step 3: Configure the Server
If it doesn’t ask questions during install, run:
$sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd
You'll be asked some questions—here’s how to answer them:
Question	Suggested Answer
Omit OpenLDAP server configuration?	No
DNS domain name?	For example: gptmcse.com (This will be part of your LDAP directory base)
Organization name?	For example: gptm
Administrator password?	Set a strong password and confirm it
Database backend to use?	MDB (default and recommended)
Remove the database when slapd is purged?	No
Move old database?	Yes
Allow LDAPv2 protocol?	No (it's outdated)
✅ After this, your LDAP server is now installed and running!

🔹 Step 4: Open LDAP Port in Firewall
Allow access from other computers:
$sudo ufw allow ldap
🔹 Step 5: Test LDAP Server
Test if your LDAP server is working:
$ldapwhoami -x
If you get this output:
anonymous
✅ That’s good! It means the server is online and responding to queries.
